# Welcome to my story

#### **Ivan Valgin** — that's my name

I'm 22 years old and I'm continiously trying to
find my place in this _World_

### achievments at now:
- golden medal at school (11 grades)
- 100/100 at chemistry **"ЕГЭ"**
- 3 and a half years spent on medical university
### and then goes not really achievments, but this is my path:
- 1 year working as senior salesman
- disappointing at my styding sphere, going further
- starts the **IT-way**
